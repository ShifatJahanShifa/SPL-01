SPL -01
(there will be a document about my work. what things i have learnt during my work). 

DAY 02: 7:32 PM 14-Jan-23
1) studying the file read and write syntax. such as: 
	-->for any type of data (without text type), we use binary data. to read and write with binary data, we use "rb" and "wb" abd "ab" format. 

	-->prototype for read function: 
		size_t fread(&buffer pointer,size_t bytes,size_t number of object,file pointer);

		description: a)buffer pointer is a void pointer to point any type of data. we can use it for single data or as a whole for the collection of data.
			     for single data, we use (&variable name). for collection of data, we use (name of the collection). 
			     
			     b)same goes with size of data. if we work with a single data, then sizeof(single data type or name). if we work with a collection, then sizeof(collection name). 
			     
			     c)number of object is usually i use 1. 
			    
			     d)file pointer. 
		           
		             e)it will return total number of objects.   

	-->prototype for write function: 
		size_t fwrite(&buffer pointer,size_t bytes,size_t number of object,file pointer);

		description: same as read function. 

	-->size_t can be treated as the largest size compiler can handle. typically it is unsigned. and with unsigned type, back loop is dangerous.
